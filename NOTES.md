Some notes for development

## Open3d and python 3.13

open3d doesn't habe python3.13 wheels in their pypi package yet. You can download the wheel files from the GitHub Actions though.

see: https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/issues/7284

Then unzip and just `pip install open3d-0.19.0-cp313-cp313-manylinux_2_35_x86_64.whl/open3d_cpu-0.19.0-cp313-cp313-manylinux_2_35_x86_64.whl`
